Thank you for purchasing the Low Poly Sci-Fi Universe (Sci-Fi at your fingertips).  A lot of effort has been put in creating this asset pack and our team is more than willing to help you setup your own scenes.

Problems, help and even more suggestions are welcome.

In order to correctly set this asset pack and enjoy it certain Unity 3D settings must be set.The project has been created using Unity 2018.3.9f1.

Include Cinemachine, Post Processing Stack and Standard Assets (Cameras) in the project using the Package Manager.

- Edit>Project Settings>Quality : V Sync Count: Don't Sync
- Edit>Project Settings>Player : Rendering Path : Deferred, Color Space Linear

Two Scenes are available in the pack. Scene1, which shows all the prefabs that are offered in the pack together and , Scene2, which is a demo scene created with all the assets. Both scenes should be set for baking  Go to Window>Lighting and check Auto for baking. 

Note that Scene2 which is large will take over an hour to bake completly. 

You also might encounter some warnings about overlapping UVs on some models, just ignore that, it wont affect anything.

5 highly detailed skyboxes are included so you can try different settings. Make sure to select each skybox png file and set its size to 4096 resolution because they are decreased for download speed reasons.

Enjoy!
